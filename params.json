  "body": "## About Me\r\nCoding comes naturally to me.  I solve problems mathematically, and sometimes, making a program feels like I'm playing a puzzle game.  In fact, I love playing \"engineer\" games such as *SpaceChem* or *Infinifactory*!  Those aren't games where you find **the** solution, but ones where you make **a** solution.  Basically, I have fun solving problems!\r\n\r\nI've been researching independent game development as a hobby, but I'm not looking into joining that industry.  I wanted to keep my games as \"pet projects\", while supporting myself with a \"day job\".  I've experimented with Game Maker Studio and making a mod for a source port of the original Doom.  One day, I hope to sell some games for cheap on places such as Steam, but I don't plan on making a living off of it.  My games will be designed how I love them, not as whatever sells the best.\r\n\r\nI'm not picky about where I want to work.  It could be something simple that lets me think about my home projects, or programming something useful so I can look forward to programming something fun at home.  As long as it pays the bills, you'll have my skills!\r\n\r\n## Education\r\n#### Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science\r\nBoise State University, 2003-2004 & 2012-2015  \r\nGPA 3.624, Graduated Cum Laude\r\n\r\n#### Associate's Degree in Electronics Technology\r\nBoise State University, 2008-2010  \r\nGPA 3.918, Graduated Magna Cum Laude\r\n\r\n## Skills\r\n#### College Experience\r\n* Java : Extensive\r\n* C : Extensive\r\n* Python : Moderate\r\n* Android : Short-term\r\n* WebGL : Short-term\r\n* JavaScript : Short-term\r\n* Android : Short-term\r\n\r\n#### Hobbies\r\n* Game Maker Studio : Extensive\r\n* Computer Graphics : Moderate\r\n* Power Tools : Moderate\r\n* Video/Sound Editing : Short-term\r\n* Carpentry : Short-term\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n#### Game Maker Samples\r\n* \"Blow Stuff Up\" : [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-abhuY9acTo) : [Download](http://matthewgillatt.github.io/BSU.exe)\r\n* \"Modern Magic\" : [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkviSdcTMAI) : [Download](http://matthewgillatt.github.io/modmag1DEMO.zip)\r\n\r\n#### Video Editing\r\n* [\"Stuff Retrogamers Say\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCoUYJSb2bw) : Written and Performed by me, edited and dubbed over in Lightworks\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n:email: majinchu (at) msn.com  \r\n:iphone: (208) 697-0301",
