<p>This is where I'll show photos of my project.</p>

<p>Coding comes naturally to me.  I solve problems mathematically, and sometimes, making a program feels like I'm playing a puzzle game.  In fact, I love playing "engineer" games such as <em>SpaceChem</em> or <em>Infinifactory</em>!  Those aren't games where you find <strong>the</strong> solution, but ones where you make <strong>a</strong> solution.  Basically, I have fun solving problems!</p>

<p>I've been researching independent game development as a hobby, but I'm not looking into joining that industry.  I wanted to keep my games as "pet projects", while supporting myself with a "day job".  I've experimented with Game Maker Studio and making a mod for a source port of the original Doom.  One day, I hope to sell some games for cheap on places such as Steam, but I don't plan on making a living off of it.  My games will be designed how I love them, not as whatever sells the best.</p>

<p>I'm not picky about where I want to work.  It could be something simple that lets me think about my home projects, or programming something useful so I can look forward to programming something fun at home.  As long as it pays the bills, you'll have my skills!</p>
