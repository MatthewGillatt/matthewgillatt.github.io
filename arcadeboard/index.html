<p>I've always been a big fan of classic arcade games.  I've seen pictures online of other peoples' MAME machines, and I thought I'd get in on that action!  I don't have room for an entire cabinet, but I'd love to play emulators using authentic arcade parts, with enough to play with friends.  I've been planning a 4-player desktop arcade controller, and I'm happy to say that at the end of Summer 2016, I've finally completed it!  I'm eager to share my handiwork with the world!</p>

<p><img src="arcade_1.jpg">Last year, when the parts arrived but I didn't have wood ready, I was eager to test them!  I measured and punched out holes into cardboard boxes as if they were wood panels, installed the parts, and even wired them to control boards underneath to make them functional!  However, I've since removed the wires and electronics, so I could not demonstrate the wiring for these photos.

<p>On the left is the first one.  2 players each had an 8-way joystick, 4 game buttons, a start button and a coin button on the front.  The switches underneath were wired to an I-PAC2 board, which treats the inputs like keyboard keys and plugs into a computer's USB port.  My nephew's had a chance to play games with this prototype!  Someday, I'm sure they'll get to play on my finished controller!</p>

<p>On the right is my second controller prototype.  A classic 1-player controller with a 4-way joystick and trackball.  The trackball and 3 buttons were wired to an Opti-Wiz board, which treats them as a USB mouse, while the joystick and other buttons went into another I-PAC2 board.  My final controller will need all of the control boards together to support 4-players and analog devices such as the trackball.  I plan on plugging them all into a USB hub inside, so that the whole box can work with a single cord coming out!</p>

<p><img src="arcade_2.jpg">The walls of the controller are being made out of 6 pieces cut out of plywood.  The lengths and angles took some careful measurements, and still took a good deal of sanding, putty, and caulk in the end to fit together.  In this picture, they are being glued together in order to cement its shape.  I later leveled the top and bottom, caulked the joints, and added corner braces to the 90 degree angles.</p>

<p><img src="arcade_3.jpg"><img src="arcade_4.jpg">The plywood for the bottom has been cut out and fitted.  Once it, it was attached to the walls with deck screws from the outside, then the screws were covered with wood putty.  The cracks were filled with caulk and then the bottom was sanded to make it smooth.</p>

<p><img src="arcade_5.jpg">Next came the paint job!  The outside was given several layers of gray primer, with fine sanding between each layer.  Then, I used Rustoleum satin black spray paint in a few layers.  I wasn't able to completely hide the wood grain of the plywood, but it's presentable.  If I needed it completely smooth, I could have used MDF for the walls and bottom, like I am with the top lid.  After the paint job, I also attached some rubber feet to the bottom.</p>

<p><img src="arcade_6.jpg">Now for the piano hinge.  It is a 30 inch long hinge, which required me to cut a mortise into the top of the back wall with my router table.  It was unwieldy, but ended up secure.  The top lid will ultimately rest on the walls with no need for cutting under the lid.</p>

<p><img src="arcade_7.jpg">The cardboard prototype of my final board!  The measurements weren't too precise in this step, because the layout was somewhat experimental.  I punched out holes using the same 1-1/8 inch forstner drill bit that I will use in the final product.</p>

<p><img src="arcade_8.jpg">The parts were installed into the prototype, and attached to the piano hinge.  I also had to cut out a hole for the trackball with a box-cutter.  I was now able to confirm that there's enough elbow room and wrist room for each player, and that the button layout was comfortable!  At some point, I also drilled 4 holes into the front sides for coin buttons.  This prototype wasn't wired, so it's not functional.</p>

<p><img src="arcade_9.jpg">My MDF board may be the most important part of the build!  It had been cut to the right shape previously, and had a slot cut out along the sides for the t-moulding.  Now, I had to carefully measure and draw where the final parts would go.</p>

<p><img src="arcade_10.jpg">Over a few hot summer days, I cut out over 40 holes in the 3/4 inch MDF with my forstner bit!  Some holes weren't quite spaced correctly, so they had to be redrilled or sanded until the push-button that fit inside had enough wiggle room to align correctly.  I also drilled and countersank the holes for the joystick mounting screws.  Once countersank, they should go underneath the vinyl covering I will attach on top.</p>

<p><img src="arcade_11.jpg">The trackball needed special attention.  First, I needed a large hole for the mechanism to fit through, so that it touched the plate on top.  I didn't have a jigsaw, so I cut it out with a long router bit instead.  Then, I had to route a shallow square on top so that the trackball's plate was flush with the surface, so it too could fit underneath the vinyl covering.</p>

<p><img src="arcade_12.jpg">The test fitting of the parts into the final board went very smoothly!  I was now confidant that I was finished cutting it, so that I could move on to decorating the MDF.</p>

<p><img src="arcade_13.jpg">The underside of the lid would partially hang over the walls, but wouldn't be covered by vinyl.  So I decided to paint it the same black spray paint as the rest of the box.  Careful use of painter's tape and cut out newspaper let be paint just the right shape without staining inside the holes!</p>
